Javascript - Huffman Encoding
Vrushil Patel

1. Download the zip file that contains the files used in running the program. 
   => there are a total of 11 files.
	"t1.txt" is the sample input file, "hamlet.txt" is main test file provided 
   => there are 7 other files that hold individual classes. 
   => And once run , one single file called "t1.txt.huff" will be added. The output will be stored in this file.

How to run the program:
1. Unzip the zipped file. The folder has 7 class files, 2 input files and 1 output file.


2. HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
		1. Use command Prompt and change to the location of this folder.

		2. now to RUN the program, use this command: *node HuffmanEncoding.js hamlet.txt*
		
		*** this should work as long as the hamlet.txt is found in the folder. AND If another file is used for testing, replace  : node huffmanEncoding.js filename 
		also adding the file in the folder is necesarry ***
		
//NOTE: i used VS Code to run the program and it took approximately 70seconds
	  Running it on Command prompt took 57 seconds

//Efficiency is the key, i tried to reduce the running time as much as i could.
// I kindly ask the viewer to wait for the ouptput according to the run times given above. Thank you for your time.
